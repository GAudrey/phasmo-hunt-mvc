#Phasmo Hunt

##Explanation

At the beginning, this project hadn't been thought in MVC at all. I just wanted to build something to make my Phasmophobia's games a little easier to follow. Then, I discovered the MVC.

It wasn't easy and I thought I would never make it several times.

And just like that... I asked myself why not do it fully in Laravel now that I had a better understanding of the MVC architecture.

You can find the laravel project [here](https://github.com/GAudrey/phasmo-hunt-project).
